##Tekteilen

 Tekteilen (German for ‘sharing-tech’) is a portal for connecting organizations needing help with web-technologies and developers wanting to share their experience to support good causes. 

Users can sign up, describe the skills they have, and then find projects that they have the ability to contribute to. 

Once part of a project, developers will have the ability to communicate internally about the project via the discussion boards available for each project.

Each User is assigned a ‘Merit’ score at the very beginning, and it increases every time they participate in a project.
